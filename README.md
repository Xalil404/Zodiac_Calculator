# Zodiac Calculator
The Zodiac calculator is a python terminal command line program which runs in the Code institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Upon the program initiating, the user is requested to enter their name and date of birth and based on the values provided, the program generates their astrological zodiac sign, qualities of the zodiac and the zodiac’s horoscope description based on three calendars: the western Gregorian calendar, the Mezo-American Mayan calendar and the Chinese calendar.

The data for the three astrological calendars was stored in a Google Sheet through the enablement of Google’s APIs for Gdrive and Google sheets and the relevant data was pulled from it and presented to the user based on the date of birth information that they provided.

## UML Diagram
Prior to initiating the development, a UML diagram was created to understand the flow of the application, steps taken during the program from beginning to end and any possible edge case scenario’s which should produce the relevant error messages for the user to understand what they did wrong.
